# TK8-Tranquility
Originally written with TekkenCore, Tranquility is all of the no-stress stuff of TekkenCore bundled into its lua script, with a handful of new features.

## Features
- Player Data and information on the loading screen can be hidden.
- Streamer Mode hides player names from showing (the game will use a hud similar to Offline Versus mode).
- Ranks can be disabled.
- Player Plates can be hidden.
- Tekken Power can be hidden.

_Progression Bar hiding and Promotion Text notices will be reimplemented back as options but is currently not available._
